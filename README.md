DIY Equatorial Camera Mount

Sorry if anything is incorrect, i'm no professional, but the result did work for me.

A single Axis, wich is driven by a high precision planetary geared Nema 17, compensates the Rotation of the Earth, when correct aligned.
The Brain of the Mount is a ESP32, operating an A4988 driver. This is set to 1/16 Stepping
The gearratio is 1/30/30 with 1/16 Stepping, this equals to 2.880.000 Steps/Revolution or 8.000 Steps/°Deg.
